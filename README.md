# MisterWhisper
 

MisterWhisper is an open-source application designed to simplify your workflow by transforming spoken words into text in real-time. When you press a designated key (F8 or F9), the application records your voice, transcribes it using the powerful Whisper AI model (GPU-accelerated for fast and efficient recognition), and directly inputs the resulting text into the currently active software.

Features

Quick voice transcription: Record and transcribe speech only while the designated key is pressed, like a walkie-talkie.

Integration with active software: Automatically inputs transcribed text into the application you are currently using.

GPU acceleration: Powered by WhisperCPP for fast and accurate voice recognition.
